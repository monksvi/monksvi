Hello, I am monksvi. I am an engineering student looking to expand my bandwidth into programming. Hell, I might just change my major entirely to either
computer science or software engineering. 

My interests are deeply invested towards programming as it is a field in high demand. There are so many things I want to introduce to the world, but that 
requires a sound grounding in knowing how to code. 

As of 28/11/2022 I am learning HTML and CSS and should pick up the basics in eight days or less. Besides those two, I am learning linear algebra,
electromagnetics, and problem solving using MATLAB. 

Currently, I am not open to collabaortions as I am not sure how I can be of help. However, I am all ears to assess what I can do. 

Feel free to reach me at:
